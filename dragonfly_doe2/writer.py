    """Generate an INP string from a Dragonfly Model.

    The resulting string will include all geometry, all fully-detailed constructions
    and materials, all fully-detailed schedules, and the room properties. It will
    also include the simulation parameters. Essentially, the string includes
    everything needed to simulate the model.

    Args:
        model: A dragonfly Model for which an INP representation will be returned.
        use_multiplier: Boolean to note if the multipliers on each Building
            story will be passed along to the generated Honeybee Room objects
            or if full geometry objects should be written for each story in the
            building. (Default: True).
        exclude_plenums: Boolean to indicate whether ceiling/floor plenum depths
            assigned to Room2Ds should generate distinct 3D Rooms in the
            translation. (Default: False).
        solve_ceiling_adjacencies: Boolean to indicate whether adjacencies should
            be solved between interior stories when Room2Ds perfectly match one
            another in their floor plate. This ensures that Surface boundary
            conditions are used instead of Adiabatic ones. (Default: True).
        merge_method: An optional text string to describe how the Room2Ds should
            be merged into individual Rooms during the translation. Specifying a
            value here can be an effective way to reduce the number of Room volumes
            in the resulting Model and, ultimately, yield a faster simulation time
            with less results to manage. Note that Room2Ds will only be merged if they
            form a contiguous volume across their solved adjacencies. Otherwise,
            there will be multiple Rooms per zone or story, each with an integer
            added at the end of their identifiers. Choose from the following options:

            * None - No merging of Room2Ds will occur
            * Zones - Room2Ds in the same zone will be merged
            * PlenumZones - Only plenums in the same zone will be merged
            * Stories - Rooms in the same story will be merged
            * PlenumStories - Only plenums in the same story will be merged

        simulation_par: A honeybee-doe2 SimulationPar object to specify how the
            DOE-2 simulation should be run. If None, default simulation
            parameters will be generated, which will run the simulation for the
            full year. (Default: None).
        hvac_mapping: Text to indicate how HVAC systems should be assigned to the
            exported model. Story will assign one HVAC system for each distinct
            level polygon, Model will use only one HVAC system for the whole model
            and AssignedHVAC will follow how the HVAC systems have been assigned
            to the Rooms.properties.energy.hvac. Choose from the options
            below. (Default: Story).

            * Room
            * Story
            * Model
            * AssignedHVAC

        exclude_interior_walls: Boolean to note whether interior wall Faces
            should be excluded from the resulting string. (Default: False).
        exclude_interior_ceilings: Boolean to note whether interior ceiling
            Faces should be excluded from the resulting string. (Default: False).
        equest_version: An optional text string to denote the version of eQuest
            for which the INP definition will be generated. If unspecified
            or unrecognized, the latest version of eQuest will be used.
